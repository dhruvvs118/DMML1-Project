# DMML1-Project
Data Mining and Machine Learning Project 

This is research on a machine learning project that used 5 different machine learning models across 3 different big datasets. 
The first dataset was from a credit card domain, and the other two were from the HR Analytics domain.
The information was found on Kaggle. All the datasets will be used for classification machine learning problems.

Datasets and there Kaggle links:
1). Dataset 1: Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset
2). Dataset 2: HR Analytics: Employee Promotion Data-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/hr-ana?select=train.csv
3). Dataset 3: HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists?select=aug_train.csv

Additional Instructions:
I have renamed the Dataset 2 file from (train.csv -> employee_promotion.csv)
I have renamed the Dataset 3 file from (aug_train.csv -> job_change.csv)

I have provided both the (.csv files the original and the renamed files)

Machine Learning Models Implemented are:
Dataset 1: KNN, Random Forest Classifier, Logistics Regression
Dataset 2: Logistics Regression and Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes
Dataset 3: Random Forest and Decision Tree

The entire coding is done using Python Programming and i have used Juypter Notebook as the editor.
To Run the code simply import the 3 (.csv files) provided in the ZIP folder and run the code.
